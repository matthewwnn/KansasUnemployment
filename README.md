# The Effects of Shared Work Programs on Job Retention: A Synthetic Control Matching Based Approach

This paper examines the impact of the 2014 reforms to Kansas’s shared work program on job retention. The Kansas shared work program allows firms to reduce their employees’ hours and apply for unemployment benefits to cover the lost wages. The 2014 reforms made the program more favorable to workers, allowing for longer benefits and higher compensation rates. Using a synthetic control matching approach, I construct a counterfactual for Kansas using other states that did not implement similar changes. The results show that the policy changes had a significant negative effect on job retention in Kansas, with an average treatment effect of -0.953 months. This suggests that the policy changes may have incentivized workers to leave their jobs and find new employment opportunities, potentially due to the increased flexibility and support provided by the shared work program. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of unemployment benefits policies on job retention and labor market dynamics.
